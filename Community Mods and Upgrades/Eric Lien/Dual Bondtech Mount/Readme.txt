I finally did something I have been meaning to do for a while. My old HercuStruder design allowed for mounting my second extruder onto the 20x20 upright extrusion since the face of the extruder sits flush with the extrusion. But the Bondtech housing does not allow for this since the clamp holds onto the planetary section of the stepper so the Bondtech housing sits forward of the face of the extrusion. I have my control box sitting out front on a hinge, it can swing out of the way to open the front door. This would swing it back into the second Bondtech. I have had it hacked to work for a while... but I finally got around to making a new mount. The model is odd looking but places both extruders exactly how I wanted them. It was as compact as I could get things while still allowing both QR hinges to swing independently. 

The only pain is that to make the print as strong as possible it should be printed laying down, so that requires a fair amount of support. This is no issue for Simplify3D. But with other slicers YMMV.

It is designed to use brass thermal set inserts in the back side to clamp it together. So depending on the size inserts you have the size of this pocket hole may need adjustment. Also please don't judge my modeling on this one. The solidworks design tree is atrocious, but I was in a hurry to finally get this done and so took a few shortcuts.
