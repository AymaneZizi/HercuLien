Herculien Build Guide
=====================

This guide is intended to get you through the basics of assembling the Herculien
3D Printer.  It is a living document so be aware that the procedure is subject to change.

Pictures are included for clarity and where necessary YouTube videos will be embedded.

The guide will be structured around the subassemblies that are listed in the BOM however
to save time later we will include parts/fasteners from other subassemblies where
needed.

Tools Required
==============

 * 2.5mm Hex Wrench
 * 3mm Hex Wrench
 * Bubble Level (for leveling the Z Gantry)
 * Multimeter
 * Saw for cutting aluminum
 * Marker
 * Masking tape
 * Metric tap set (only a 5mm tap is required)
 * Drill
 * 1mm drill bit or equivalent imperial standard bit (This is just used for drilling pilot holes so it doesn't have to be precise but needs to be small enough to fit in the drill guide)
 * 5mm drill bit
 * 8mm drill bit
 * 7/8" drill bit
 * 1/2" End mill
 
Metal Preparation
=================

 1. Using the 5mm x .8 thread tap, tap all of the regular 20x80 extrusion end holes
    * Use cutting oil
    * Go Slow
    * You can either do by hand or using a drill.  If you use a drill you must take it VERY slow as you can easily break the tap bit.
 
    Example:

Main Frame
==========

## Parts required:

 * 9x 20x80 Aluminum Extrusions cut to 569.5mm
 * 4x 20x20 Aluminum Extrusions cut to 609.5mm
 * 2x 20x80 V-Slot Aluminum Extrusions
 * 102x T-Slot Nuts
 * 160x M5 x 10mm Button Head Screws
 * 6x M5 x 8mm Flat Head Socket Cap Screws
 * 16x M5 x 8mm Button Head Screws

## Bottom Assembly

 1. The BOM lists a 1 meter section of V-Slot, if you haven't cut the V-Slot you should do that now.
    * To cut the V-Slot you can use any saw or cutting wheel capable of cutting through a 20x80 extrusion.
    * I was successful doing this with an angle grinder and metal cutoff blade.
    * While you should be careful to cut this as straight as possible it isn't necessary to
      cut this exactly straight.  The factory cut ends are straight and those will be what is used
      to square the verticals for the Z Gantry rails to be perpendicular to the center rail.
    
 2. Using your marker and masking tape, label each of the 9 20x80 extrusions using the following labels.  These labels aren't necessary
    but will make things easier in the following steps to keep things in order.  It also helps to indicate which end it up, I use arrows
    on the masking labels.
    
    * Top Front
    * Top Rear
    * Top Right
    * Top Left
    * Bottom Front
    * Bottom Rear
    * Bottom Right
    * Bottom Left
    * Center Rail
    
    Example:
    ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_141237.jpg "20x80 Extrusion Label")

 3. Using your marker and masking tape, label each of the 4 20x20 extrusions with the following labels.
    * Front Right
    * Rear Right
    * Front Left
    * Rear Left
    
    Example:
    ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_141252.jpg "20x20 Extrusion Label")
  
 4. Locate the 4 20x20 extrusions to be used at vertical supports for the main frame.
  
 5. Using 3 M5x8mm button head screws and 2 T-Slot nuts attach the 20x20 extrusion drill guide to one end of the extrusion.
  
     Examples: ![alt text](./Photos/1424094009658.jpg "20x20 Extrusion Drill Guide 1")
               ![alt text](./Photos/1424094010046.jpg "20x20 Extrusion Drill Guide 2")
  
 6. Using the 5mm drill bit, drill all 8 holes using the raised drill guide holes.
     
     Result: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_155826.jpg "20x20 Extrusion drilled")
  
 7. Repeat this process for the other end of the extrusion and then for the remaining 3 verticals.
  
 8.  Locate the two 20x80 extrusions marked "Bottom Right" and "Bottom Left"
  
 9.  Beginning with one of these, use 4 M5x8mm button head screws and 4 T-Slot nuts attach the 20x80 8 hole drill guide but do not tighten down.
  
 10. Measure from one end of the extrusion 215mm and slide the drill guide over until the very edge of it lines up with that line.
      
      Drawing: ![alt text](./Drawings/Location_Of_Vertical_Z-Bed_Vslot_Guides.jpg "Drawing")
      
 11. Tighten the drill guide down and double check your measurement until it is **EXACT**
  
 12. Drill all 8 holes using the 5mm drill bit.
  
 13. Repeat for the other piece making sure your measurements are **EXACT**
  
 14. Orient the two pieces standing on their 20mm side on the floor or other flat surface keeping the perspective that you are looking at the completed chassis from the front.  e.g. "Bottom Left" goes to your left and "Bottom right" goes to your right.
  
 15. Ensure the 2 rows of holes you just drilled are nearest the top of the extrusion and the side measured 215mm from edge to the drill guide is placed facing you.
  
 16. Now using the masking tape and markers label the inside face of each so that the orientation is clear.
      
      Result: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_161343.jpg "20x80mm Extrusion Bottom Right")
              ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_161352.jpg "20x80mm Extrusion Bottom Left")
              ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_161413.jpg "20x80mm Extrusions properly oriented")
   
 17. Locate the 20x80 extrusion pieces marked "Bottom Front" and "Bottom Rear"
 
 18. Orient the pieces on the floor or flat surface with the 2 bottom left and right extrusions with one 20mm side lying flat on the surface.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_175620.jpg "20x80mm Extrusions oriented correctly")
 
 19. Using the marker and masking tape, label the inside of each and use an drawn arrow to indicate which way is up.
 
 20. On the piece marked "Bottom Rear" insert 2 T-Slot nuts in the top row of the innermost side.  Insert 4 T-Slot nuts in the row below that.  Insert 2 T-Slot nuts in the row below that.  Use M5x10mm button head screws hand tightened to hold them in place.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_175640.jpg "Bottom Rear Extrusion Nuts Installed")

 21. On the piece marked "Bottom Front" insert 1 T-Slot nut on the top row of the innermost side.  Insert 1 T-Slot nut in the row below that.  Use M5x10mm button head screws, hand tightened, to hole them in place.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_175717.jpg "Bottom Front Extrusion Nuts Installed")
 
 22. On the piece marked "Bottom Right" insert 3 T-Slot nuts on the top row and use M5x10mm button top screws, hand tightened, to hold them in place.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_175657.jpg "Bottom Right Extrusion Nuts installed")
 
 23. Thread M5x10mm button head screws into each of the 4 holes on each end of the 4 bottom 20x80mm extrusions placed on the flat surface from earlier.  Thread the screws in until there is only approximately 3-4mm of thread showing.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_183040.jpg "Extrusion end screws installed")
 
 24. Locate the 20x80 extrusion labeled "Center Rail"
 
 25. Thread M5x10mm button head screws in the 4 holes in each of the ends of the "Center Rail" leaving only about 3-4mm of thread showing.
 
 26. Slide one side of the center rails button head screws in the bottom left 20x80 extrusion's second from the top slot and visually line it up with the 4 holes that are drilled in the bottom left piece.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_215620.jpg "Attaching Center Rail to Bottom Left extrusion")
     
 27. Using your measuring tool measure 215mm from the front edge of the "Bottom Left" 20x80mm extrusion to the edge of the "Center Rail".
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_215705.jpg "Measuing Center Rail Placement")
 
 28. Passing the 2.5mm hex wrench through the holes in the opposite side of the "Front Left" extrusion tighten the button head screws on the "Center Rail" locking them in place.  Be sure to double check your measurements.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_215904.jpg "Tightening the Center Rail")
 
 29. The Front of the Center rail is now the side measured 215mm away from the front edge of the supporting extrusion.  If it helps you to keep track of these things use the masking tape and marker to label the side that is front.
 
 30. On the front side of the center rail insert 2 T-Slot nuts and use 2 M5x10mm button head screws, hand tightened, to hold them in place. On the top of the "Center Rail" in the first of four slots insert 4 T-Slot nuts with M5x10mm button head screws to hold them in place.  Do the same for the second from the front edge slot.  Skip the third slot and on the foourth slot from the front insert 2 T-Slot Nuts with 2 M5x10mm button head screws to hole them in place.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_215946.jpg "Setup T-Slot nuts for later mounting things")
     
 31. Now repeat step 26-28 for the other side of the Center Rail, securing the Center Rail to the "Bottom Right" 20x80mm extrusion.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_220036.jpg "Finished Center Rail")
 
 32. Locate the 2 V-Slot 20x80 extrusions measuring 489.5mm.  These do not need labels as they are identical and either will work on either side.
 
 33. With one of the V-Slot extrusions on one 80mm side nearest the factory straight cut insert 1 T-Slot nut in each slot and hand thread 1 M5x8mm button head screw for each T-Slot nut but do not tighten.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_230648.jpg "V-Slot extrusion with T-Slot nuts prepped")
 
 34. Slide the button head screws in the top slot of the "Bottom Left" 20x80mm extrusion.  I find it's easier to stand the "Bottom Left", "Center Rail" and "Bottom Right" assembled pieces on one end so that it looks like an "H".
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_230750.jpg "Inserting V-Slot button head screws into 20x80mm T-Slot extrusion")
 
 35. Carefully slide this assembly down the rail and place it sitting on top of the Center Rail extrusion and make sure the edges of the V-Slot are flush with the Center Rail extrusion on both sides.
 
 36. Passing the 2.5mm hex wrench through the holes on the opposite side of the "Bottom Left" extrusion tighten down each screw.
 
 37. Double check your measurements and ensure that the front 20mm edge of the V-Slot extrusion is exactly 215mm away from the front edge of the "Bottom Left" extrusion.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_230940.jpg "V-Slot vertical in place")
 
 38. Repeat steps 33-37 for the "Bottom Right" 20x80mm extrusion using the remaining V-Slot extrusion.
 
 39. Locate the 4 20x20 extrusions that are 609.5mm long.  These are the verticals to hold everything upright.
 
 40. Find the 20x80 extrusions marked "Bottom Front" and "Bottom Left" and use the 20x20 vertical marked "Front Left" for the next step.
     
 41. Slide button head screws at the end of the "Bottom Front" 20x80 extrusion's left side into the slot of the 20x20mm extrusion and then do the same with the 20x80mm "Bottom Left" extrusion at a right angle to the "Bottom Front" extrusion.  See picture for example.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150214_123942.jpg "Building a corner")
 
 42. Use your 2.5mm hex wrench to tighten the button head screws by passing the wrench through the holes drilled in the 20x20 extrusion.  **ENSURE** the bottom of the 20x80 extrusions are flush with the bottom of the vertical 20x20 extrusion.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_225212.jpg "Corner Vertical installed")
     
 43. Repeat steps 25-27 for the 4 corners paying close attention to use the correct vertical per corner.  If you use the wrong one, you can switch their labels once you're finished.  The labeling matters in the coming steps.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150220_232801.jpg "All corners done, bottom assembly complete")
 
## Top Assembly

 1. Locate the 20x80mm extrusion marked "Top Front" and lay it flat on one of it's 80mm sides in front of you.
 
 2. We will assume this is now the inside of the top front extrusion and the 20mm side furthest from you is the side that will be at the top of the finished chassis., mark it with the tape and marker.
    
    Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150221_190037.jpg "Top Front extrusion properly labeled")
    
 3. Locate Corner Bearing Bracket B, this is a printed part.
 
 4. Place Corner Bearing Bracket B on the right side of the 80mm side facing you with the bearing support hole closest to the edge of the printed part laying flat on the extrusion.  Make sure the printed part is lined up against the right edge with the opposing bearing support hole vertical and flush with the edge.
 
    Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150221_190514.jpg "Corner Bearing Bracket B placed properly on extrusion")
 
 5. Locate the printed extrusion drill guide shown below.

 34. Place the aluminum heat spreader into the mdf insulator board and use the heat spreader as a drill guide to drill the insulator board.
 
 35. Align the holes in the insulator board and heat spreader with the 519.5mm 20x20mm extrusions of the Z-Gantry.  Center the insulator board between the 2 gantry plates and clamp them together.
 
 36. Using the insulator and heat spreader as a drill guide, drill the 5mm holes in the 4 corners of the heat spreader.
 
 37. Remove the clamps and lay the heat spreader on a flat surface.
 
 38. Using a countersinking bit or a larger drill bit that is wider than the head of the M5 flat head screws drill countersinks for all 6 holes of the heat spreader. Make sure that the countersink is deep enough to keep the head of the flat head M5 screws below the surface of the aluminum heat spreader or you risk cracking the corner of the glass that clips on top.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150301_022653.jpg "Counter sunk hole")
              ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150301_103824.jpg "All holes done")
 
 39. Using a larger bit than the original 5mm, I'd say 6 or 7mm, drill out the 4 holes in the 519.5mm 20x20 extrusions to allow the heated bed adjustment to move without binding.
 
 40. Set the gantry assembly aside for now.
 
 41. Locate 4 M5x70mm flat head hex screws, 2 M5x30mm flat head hex screws, 6 M5 nylon lock nuts and 6 M5 oversized washers (15mm OD)

 56. Repeat steps 52 - 53 for the other middle hole of the aluminum heat spreader.
 
 57. Set this assembly aside for later use.
 
 58. Locate the printed parts "Z Leadscrew Bearing Holder Base" and "Z Leadscrew Bearing Holder Top", there should be 2 of each.
 
 59. Insert 1 608ZZ 8x22x7 bearing in each piece.
 
     **TIPS**
     
      * If the bearing won't fit because the hole it too tight then use a q-tip and acetone to wet the inside walls of the seating surface.  Repeat this until the walls are soft enough to allow you to press fit the bearings.
      * If the bearing fits but is loose then use thin kapton tape wrapped around the bearing evenly to shim the bearing into the holder.

 78. Holding the Z-Gantry assembly with the leadscrews inserted and the pulleys facing down slide the assembly onto the V-Slot aligning the wheels.  Feed the leadscrew through the 1164mm GT2 closed loop belt and then feed the remaining tapered end of each leadscrew through the 8mm shim washer and into the bearing underneath.
 
 79. Place 1 M5 standard washer on 1 M5x25mm socket head screw, repeat this for one more M5x25mm screw.
 
 80. Feed these screws through each of the holes of one of the Z axis top bearing holders.
 
 81. Secure 1 T-Slot nut on the end of each of the M5x25mm screws.
 
 82. Place 1 8mm shim washer on the top of the lead screw feeding the short tapered end of the lead screw through the hole of the washer.
 
 83. Feed the remaining portion of the taper through the bearing hole of the Z-Axis top assembly with the flat side of the bearing holder facing the V-Slot. As you are doing this you will need to take special care to feed the T-Slot nuts threaded on the M5x25mm screws into the left and right most slots of the V-Slot extrusion.
 
 84. Tighten the 2 M5x25mm socket head screws to firmly affix the top bearing holder to the V-Slot.

 87.  Align the belt with the 2 36 tooth pulleys.
 
 88. Use a bubble level to ensure that the Z Gantry is level.  This is essential before testing the z axis for binding. If the Z gantry is off level manually spin one of the lead screws to bring it into level.  If the leadscrew won't turn you have binding.  See the next step for tips.
 
 89. Level the Z axis. The Z axis must be level in all directions in order to spin freely.  The following are tips for leveling your Z axis.
    
      * If you have binding on either leadscrew, loosen the 2 screws holding the leadscrew nut to the Z gantry plate.
      * You can use a magnetic bubble level attached to the leadscrews to square them up.
      * The if you have lateral binding of the leadscrews to the left and right side you can loosen the bearing blocks at the bottoms and move them closer or further away from the V-Slot.
      * In some cases (when the Z Gantry holes for the delrin nut aren't true) you will need to sand material off of the seating surface of either the top or bottom bearing holders.
 
 90. Locate 1 printed motor mount, 1 nema 17 stepper motor, 4 M3x8mm button head screws and 4 M3 standard size washers.

 2. Press fit 1 10mm (ID) x 22mm (OD) bearing into each of the bearing holes of the 4 printed corner bearing brackets.
    
    Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_080415.jpg "Corner bearing brackets with bearings inserted")
    
    * If the bearing holes are too tight, use acetone and a q-tip to wet the bearing hole walls until the abs is soft. Then press fit the bearing in.
    * If the bearing holes are too loose, wrap the outside wall of the bearing with a thin layer of kapton tape to shim the bearing.
    
 3. Starting with the front left top corner of the inside of the chassis place the corner bearing bracket that matches up with the holes drilled through the top extrusions.  This should be corner bearing bracket B.
    
    Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_080501.jpg "Top left corner bearing bracket placed")
    
 4. On each side of the bracket you should remove enough of the prepopulated M5x10mm button head screws from the t-slot nuts that were installed earlier to be able to secure each of the screw holes of the corner bearing bracket plate.
 
 5. Using a hex wrench slide 1 t-slot nut behind one of the inner most screw holes of the corner bearing bracket and secure it with 1 M5x10mm screw.  Make sure that the corner bearing bracket is flush with the corner of the extrusions.  This is necessary for proper X/Y alignment.
    
    Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_080805.jpg "Inner most screw hole secured")
    
 6. Repeat this process for all of the holes of the corner bearing bracket.

 14. Press fit the bronze bushings into the large holes of the XY Axis Belt Tensioner printed part.
 
      * If the fit is too tight, use acetone and a q-tip to soften the inner wall of the printed part's bushing hole and then press the bushing in.
      * If the fit is too loose, use kapton tape to shim the bushing and then press the bushing in.
      
      Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_214125.jpg "Bushing press fit into belt tensioner")
      
 15. Thread 1 M3x50mm socket cap screw through one of the 3mm holes in the bottom of the XY Axis Belt Tensioner.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_214225.jpg "M3x50mm socket cap screw")
              ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150305_203920.jpg "Completed XY Tensioner")
              
 16. Repeat the process for the other hole.
  
 17. Fit the XY Belt Tensioner Block's 2 holes on the end of the 2 M3x50mm screws taking care to align the slot for the GT2 belt.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_214918.jpg "Belt Slot aligned")
              ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150305_204236.jpg "Belt slot aligned")
     
 18. Screw the screws through the tensioner block but not all the way.
  
 19. Screw on 1 nylon locknut on the end of each of the M3x50mm screws.
  
 20. Thread 1 M3x25mm through one of the belt slots.
  
 21. Screw on one nylon lock nut on the end of the screw but do not tighten.
  
 22. Repeat steps 10 - 11 for the other belt retension screw hole.
  
 23. Insert the M5 standard hex nut into the slot on top of the XY Axis Belt Tensioner.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_215020.jpg "Completed XY Tensioner")
     
 24. Thread 1 M5x16mm button head screw through the recessed screw hole and thread the screw into the nut in the opposing side of the tensioner. DO NOT TIGHTEN! You will crack the part!!!  Just let the threads grab.
  
 25. The finished assembly will look like this:
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_215020.jpg "Completed XY Tensioner")
  
 26. Repeat these steps for the other XY Axis Belt Tensioner A piece as well as the other 2 XY Axis belt tensioner pieces.  
  
 27. Set them aside for now.
  
 28. Locate the dual hotend carriage printed part.
 
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_212504.jpg "Hot end carriage")
  
 29. Insert M3 standard nuts into each of the slots of the carriage making sure to press them in until they are fully seated.
  
 30. Using the q-tip or kapton tape method described in step 14 press fit 1 10mm sintered bronze bushing into each busching hole of the carriage taking care to ensure that they're fully seated level or you will have binding issues.  Test the alignment by inserting a 512mm precision hardened rod into one of the axis and move the carriage up and down the shaft.  It should move as if there were a cushion of air between the bushing and the rod.
  
     * If you have minor binding you can insert one of the 512mm hardened precision rods into an electric drill and insert the precision rod into one of the carriage axis.  Then start spinning the rod slowly with the drill while moving the carriage up and down the shaft to force the self aligning bushings into alignment.
     * If you have major binding you can set the rod end on a hard surface and gently knock the bushing in by knocking the carriage into the hard surface.  Take care not to knock too hard or you could crack the carriage.
  
 31. Insert 1 512mm precision hardened rod through each axis of the carriage and set on a flat surface with the flat side of the carriage facing up and the end of the carriage that will house the hotends facing you.  This is the orientation of the carriage in the chassis when you are looking at the front.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150304_212527.jpg "Carriage placed flat")

 42. Install a 10mm shim washer, then slide the end of the rod into the bearing.
  
 43. Repeat steps 27 - 32 for all 4 rods making sure to keep things as aligned as possible.  The rods with the rod end knobs should be used for the 2 rods that go on the front left side and the left front side extrusions.
  
 44. Locate one 1 meter section of GT2 belt.
  
 45. Choose one side of the chassis and slide the end of the belt into the slot of the XY belt tensioner block taking care to slide the belt into the block until it is fully seated and the teeth of the belt have engaged in the block's teeth thus keeping the belt locked in place.
  
 46. Locate 1 M3x25mm socket cap screw and 1 nylon lock nut.
  
 47. Thread the screw through the screw hole in the tensioner block and install the nylon lock nut on the screw end.
  
 48. Tighten the lock nut until the screw is snug, do not over tighten or you will crack the printed part.
  
 49. Pass the GT2 belt around the 32 tooth pulley on the side of the block that you installed the belt end into.
  
 50. Stretch the belt over the opposing 32 tooth pulley and back around to the XY belt tensioner.
  
 51. Cut the belt to length leaving enough belt to fit through the belt slot of the tensioner to help with seating the belt.
  
 52. Slide the belt end into the belt tensioner slot and seat the belt completely making sure that the teeth of the belt seat inside of the belt tensioner.
  
 53. Locate 1 M3x25mm socket cap screw and 1 nylon lock nut.
  
 54. Thread the screw through the screw hole in the tensioner and install the nylon lock nut ont he screw end.
  
 55. Tighten the lock nut until the screw is snug.  Do not over tighten or you will crack the printed part.
  
 56. Now using a hex wrench and 5.5mm socket wrench adjust each of the 50mm socket cap screws that run through the tensioner and tensioner block until the belt is tight but not guitar string tight.
     
     Example: ![alt text](./Photos/IMG_20150308_143536.jpg "Belt complete")
     
 57. Repeat steps 35 through 46 for the remaining 3 sides.
  
 58. You should now be able to use the 2 rod end knobs on the front and left side to move the XY carriage, like an Etch-a-sketch.
